# CIG2018 - Experimental Results

Steps to reproduce results in paper:

1) compile the code with the *make* command;
2) run *./main* (this will take a while);
3) enter each of the generated directories (one level down) and run *matlab ../make\_graphs.m* or alternatively *octave ../make\_graphs.m*.

# CIG2018 - Theoretical Results

*theory\_helper.m* contains the code that generates the transition matrices and calculates the theoretical results reported in the paper.
